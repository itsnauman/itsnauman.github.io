# dataframing

This is a Jekyll blog theme/layout I forked from Github user [getmicah](https://github.com/getmicah). It's simple and clean and I like it :)

Below is the README included in the original repository. The instructions for getting setup with Jekyll are pretty clear, but feel free to reach out if something doesn't make sense! I've probably stumbled over that same problem and I'm happy to help.

### To-do

- Make things not terrible on mobile :)
- Get that bookshelf populated!
- Get site title to change from `dataframe | home` to `dataframe | about` to `dataframe | <post title>`
- Fix the highlighting what even is that
