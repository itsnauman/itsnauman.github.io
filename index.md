Hi, I'm Nauman Ahmad.
I am a 18-year-old
software developer
currently studying
Computer Science at NYU.

I'm like building web applications
and APIs for mobile apps,
as well as creating tools
for developers.

I love going to hackathons and working
on open source [projects](projects.html).
You can find my work on [GitHub][github].

I mainly work with HTML/CSS, Python, Javascript, Java
Flask and Node.js on OSX.
