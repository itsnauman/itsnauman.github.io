Hi, I'm Nauman Ahmad.
I am a 19-year-old
software developer
currently studying
Computer Science at NYU. I'm obsessed with software architecture, code quality and building things.

I spend my days coding web app backends,
APIs and Arduinos, and I play video games in my
spare time.

I love going to hackathons and working
on open source [projects](projects.html).
You can find my work on [GitHub][github].
Email me if you want to work on something cool
together!

I mainly work with HTML/CSS, Python, Flask, Javascript, Node.js and Java
on OSX.
