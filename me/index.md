Hi! My name is Nauman Ahmad ðŸ˜€. I'm a junior studying Computer Science at New York University who's passionate about using Machine Learning and Software Engineering to solve a wide variety of problems. My goal is to build products that change peoples' lives while learning something new every day.

I love great food, NYC, coffee and vim in no particular order.
